Issue Summary

Duration:
The outage lasted 3 hours, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM UTC on August 15, 2024.

Impact:
During the outage, our primary e-commerce service was slow to respond, with an average response time increase of 300%. Approximately 60% of users experienced slow load times or were unable to complete transactions. This resulted in a significant decrease in conversion rates, leading to an estimated revenue loss of $50,000.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was a memory leak in the application serverâ€™s session management module. The leak caused the server to consume excessive memory, leading to a slowdown and eventual crashes under high load.

Timeline
3:00 PM UTC:
Issue detected by automated monitoring, which alerted on high response times and elevated memory usage on the application servers.

3:10 PM UTC:
Initial investigation began by the on-call engineer, who suspected a database performance issue due to a recent schema update.

3:30 PM UTC:
Database team investigated, but found no issues with the database; escalation moved to the application team.

4:00 PM UTC:
Application logs indicated high memory usage, leading to the hypothesis of a memory leak in the session management module.

4:30 PM UTC:
Misleading investigation path: Engineers assumed the issue was related to a third-party library update, leading to unnecessary rollback attempts.

5:00 PM UTC:
Realized the issue was not related to the third-party library and focused on session management code. A memory profiling tool was deployed, confirming the memory leak.

5:30 PM UTC:
Temporary mitigation was implemented by restarting affected servers, which temporarily resolved the issue. Root cause was identified as a flaw in session management code.

6:00 PM UTC:
A patch was deployed to fix the memory leak, and the system was fully operational.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was a bug in the session management module that failed to properly clean up expired sessions. This led to an accumulation of session objects in memory, causing the server to consume more memory than available, eventually leading to server slowdowns and crashes under heavy traffic.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by patching the session management module to correctly free memory allocated to expired sessions. A temporary solution involved restarting servers to clear the memory, which provided relief until the patch could be deployed. The final patch was tested in a staging environment before being rolled out to production.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Code Review:
Conduct a thorough code review of the session management module to identify any additional memory management issues.

Enhanced Monitoring:
Implement detailed memory usage monitoring for the application servers, specifically tracking session object growth over time.

Stress Testing:
Perform regular stress testing on staging environments to identify potential performance bottlenecks under high load.

Incident Response Training:
Provide additional training for the engineering team on debugging memory-related issues, to reduce time spent on misleading paths.

Tasks:

 -Patch the session management module in all environments.
 -Add memory usage alerts specific to session object growth.
 -Schedule and perform a stress test on the staging environment by September 1, 2024.
 -Organize a post-incident review meeting and training session by August 30, 2024.
 -Review and update the on-call playbook to better handle memory-related incidents.
 
This postmortem provides a detailed analysis of the incident and outlines the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence. By addressing these points, we aim to strengthen our infrastructure and improve our incident response process.
